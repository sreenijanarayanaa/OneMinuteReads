ðŸ‘‰ Can you explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication in microservices? Can you give examples of how youâ€™ve used each in a project?

===> Synchronous communication 
* It's like having a conversation on the phone
* we talk, then the other person immediately responds while both of we are connected.
* Client waits for the response â€” like a phone call. 
* In microservices, this is typically done via REST or gRPC calls. 
* For example, 
In my project, our Order Service synchronously calls the Payment Service via REST to process a payment

===> Asynchronous communicationis 
* It's like sending an email
* we send a message and the other person can reply whenever they have time, without both needing to be present at the same moment.
* Sender doesnâ€™t wait for an immediate response.
* In microservices, this is done using message brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ. 
* For example, 
After an order was placed, the Order Service published an event to Kafka, and multiple consumers like Notification Service and Inventory Service processed it independently.

==> Note : 
In software, synchronous means waiting for a task to finish before starting another,
while asynchronous allows tasks to run in the background, letting we do multiple things at once.
