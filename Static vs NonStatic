ðŸ”¹ Static vs Non-Static in Java
Aspect	                 Static	                                                                Non-Static
Belongs to	             Class	                                                               Object (instance)
Memory                   Allocation	Only once, in method area	For each object,                 in heap Access	Can be accessed without object (via ClassName.member)	Needs object to access
Variables	               Shared across all objects	                                           Each object has its own copy
Methods	                 Belong to class, cannot use this or super	                           Belong to objects, can use this and super
When to Use            	 For constants, utility methods, counters, caches	When behavior/data   Can be overridden in subclass 
                         depends on object state Overriding	Cannot be overridden 
                         (only hidden if subclass declares same static method)	


ðŸ”¹ Static Members 
Static methods cannot be overridden (only hidden).
Constructors cannot be static.
this and super cannot be used in static context.
Static class = only allowed as nested.
Static variables are shared, but not thread-safe by default.
