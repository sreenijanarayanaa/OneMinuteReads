ðŸ‘‰ Suppose you are securing a REST API in Spring Boot. How would you implement authentication & authorization so that:
â€¢	Only authenticated users can access APIs, and
â€¢	Some endpoints are restricted to ADMIN role only?

To secure a REST API in Spring Boot:

Authentication:
â€¢	Iâ€™d use Spring Security with JWT. 
When a user logs in (e.g., /login endpoint), we validate their username/password against the database (using a UserDetailsService).
â€¢	On success, we generate a JWT token and return it. The client includes this token in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header for subsequent requests.

Authorization:
â€¢	In the SecurityFilterChain, we configure which endpoints require which roles. For example:
@Bean
SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    return http
        .csrf().disable()
        .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
            .requestMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
            .requestMatchers("/user/**").hasAnyRole("USER","ADMIN")
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
        )
        .oauth2ResourceServer(oauth2 -> oauth2.jwt()) // if using OAuth2/JWT
        .build();
}
â€¢	This ensures only authenticated users can access APIs, 
and only users with the ADMIN role can access /admin endpoints.

ðŸ‘‰ Why JWT? 
JWT makes the API stateless â€” no session storage needed on the server. 
Also, it scales better for microservices since tokens can be validated without hitting the DB each time.


ðŸ‘‰In your microservices, how do you secure APIs so only authorized clients can access them? Have you used JWT, OAuth2, or any other approach?

In our microservices, we secure APIs using Spring Security with JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization.

Authentication:
When a user tries tp logs in, their credentials are validated via a custom UserDetailsService(I) that loads user info from the database.
If valid, we generate a JWT token that contains user details and roles. 
This token is then included in the Authorization header (Bearer token) for every request.

Authorization: 
We use role-based access control. 
In the security config, we use methods like .hasRole("ADMIN") or annotations like @PreAuthorize("hasRole('USER')") to restrict access.

Validation: 
A JWT filter in the Spring Security filter chain validates the token for every incoming request before passing it to the controller. 
If invalid or expired, we return 401 Unauthorized.

Service-to-service security:
For inter-service calls, the services also pass a JWT, ensuring only authorized services can talk to each other.

This way, our APIs are stateless, secure, and scalable, without relying on server-side sessions.

"We secure APIs using JWT with Spring Security. On login, a JWT is generated and passed in the Authorization header"
"A custom filter validates the token on each request, and role-based access is enforced using hasRole and @PreAuthorize. This keeps the system stateless and scalable."

ðŸ‘‰To secure REST APIs between microservices, I would use a combination of authentication, authorization, and transport security:

At the API Gateway level, Iâ€™d enforce authentication, usually with OAuth2 or JWT tokens.
The client first authenticates (e.g., via Keycloak or Spring Security OAuth2), gets a token, and then every request passes through the gateway with this token.

Each downstream microservice validates the token independently to ensure it hasnâ€™t been tampered with and to check user roles/permissions for authorization.  
This makes each service secure, even if someone bypasses the gateway.

All inter-service communication happens over HTTPS to protect data in transit.

Optionally, for sensitive services, we can use mutual TLS (mTLS) so that services authenticate each other, not just the client.

This layered approach ensures that microservices remain secure, scalable, and independent.
