ðŸ‘‰ Imagine you are designing an E-commerce Order Service in a microservices architecture. When a user places an order, you need to:
1.	Save the order in MySQL.
2.	Notify the Payment Service.
3.	Notify the Notification Service (to send an email/SMS).
How would you design this flow using Spring Boot & microservices best practices?


When a user places an order, the Order Service first persists the order in MySQL using Spring Data JPA.
Next:
1.	Payment Service â†’
Iâ€™d call synchronously via REST (e.g., RestTemplate or WebClient) 
because the user needs an immediate response on payment success/failure. 
If the payment fails, Iâ€™d update the order status to FAILED.

2.	Notification Service â†’ 
Iâ€™d decouple this using Kafka. After saving the order, Order Service publishes an OrderCreated event to a Kafka topic. 
The Notification Service consumes this event and uses JavaMailSender to send emails. 
This way, if the Notification Service is down, order placement isnâ€™t blocked.


This design combines synchronous calls where necessary (Payment), and asynchronous, event-driven communication 
where decoupling improves scalability and resilience (Notification).
