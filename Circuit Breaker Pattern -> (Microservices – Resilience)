ðŸ‘‰ In microservices, suppose your Order Service calls the Payment Service synchronously. 
If the Payment Service is down or very slow, how would you prevent your Order Service from hanging indefinitely?

If the Payment Service is down or slow, we can apply the Circuit Breaker pattern using a library like Resilience4j.

â€¢	The Circuit Breaker has three states:
Closed: 
calls flow as normal.

Open:
after a threshold of failures, it stops making calls to the Payment Service and fails fast.

Half-Open:
after a wait period, it allows a few trial requests to check if the Payment Service has recovered.

â€¢	Along with the circuit breaker, we also configure timeouts so the Order Service doesnâ€™t hang indefinitely waiting for a response.

â€¢	We can also provide a fallback method
â€” for example, returning a message like â€˜Payment is currently unavailableâ€™ or queueing the order for later processing.

This improves resilience and prevents cascading failures in microservices.

"We can also use Kafka for asynchronous communication in non-critical flows, so services donâ€™t block each other if one is temporarily unavailable"
