ðŸ‘‰ In your current claims processing project, 
how do you handle inter-service communication between microservices? 
Do you use REST, messaging (Kafka), or both? Can you explain why?

In our claims processing system, we use both synchronous and asynchronous inter-service communication depending on the use case.

For synchronous communication, where we need an immediate response 
â€” for example, when our Claim Service calls the Policy Service to validate policy details
â€” we use REST APIs over HTTP. This ensures the calling service gets the required response before proceeding.

For asynchronous communication, where the caller shouldnâ€™t wait 
â€” for example, sending notification emails or updating audit logs
â€” we use Kafka as a message broker. This allows us to decouple services, improve scalability, and handle spikes in traffic through message queues and retries.

In short, REST for real-time request-response and Kafka for event-driven communication.

"We use REST for synchronous communication when one service depends on an immediate response, like claim validation. 
For asynchronous use cases, such as sending emails or publishing events, we use Kafka, which decouples services and improves scalability."
